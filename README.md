Just created a GitHub account and looking forward to get used to it.
The respiratory I created used a Python code from  PyCharm.
Steps I took to clone the repository onto my local machine: I logged in into my GitHub account, selected the "clone a repository" option, I cloned the "Hansisaacg.github.io." repository, cloned the repository into a new file and downloaded a copy of my repository onto my local machine.
